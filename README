# Contacts React Application Project

## Project Overview

This project is a Contacts React Application designed to demonstrate advanced ReactJS skills including state management, data fetching, and dynamic user interactions. The application fetches user data from a placeholder API and provides features such as searching, sorting, and categorizing the contacts based on user interaction.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Contacts data is dynamically fetched from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`.
- **Interactive Search and Filter**: Users can search for contacts based on specific attributes (name, username, email, etc.), with support for nested objects like address and company.
- **Sorting Functionality**: Contacts can be sorted alphabetically in ascending or descending order.
- **Grouping of Contacts**: Contacts are grouped by the first letter of their name, providing an organized view.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes TailwindCSS for a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript ES6+**: For modern JavaScript features.
- **SVG**: For icons and visual indicators.

## Personal Development and Achievements
